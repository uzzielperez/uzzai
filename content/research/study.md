I'm a postdoctoral researcher/ research engineer at La Salle Campus, Barcelona. I'm currently actively working on implementing lightweight Graph Neural Networks for Real Time Analysis for reconstructing particles at the LHCb experiment. I'm also interested in using Large Language Models for Physics analysis as well as joining efforts in creating Large Physics Models. 

I also have other passion projects such as building applications with text-to-speech AI and using LLMs for open-source patient-centered augmented healthcare intelligence. I know there are a lot of buzzwords here. Happy to discuss more if our interests align!
